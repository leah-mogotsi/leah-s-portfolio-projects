# leah-s-portfolio-projects
This portfolio contains a collection of my projects demonstrating skills in data analysis, machine learning and business intelligence. Each project showcases a systematic approach to solving problems with data, from initial cleaning and exploratory data analysis(EDA), to predictive modelling and the creation of interactive dashboards.
